👋 About Me

Hello there! My name is Rogers, a 19-year-old Computer Science student at the University of Port Harcourt (UniPort). I’m a passionate and ambitious young leader driven by purpose, innovation, and impact. My interests span across business, finance, technology, politics, sports, and writing — all of which shape the person I am becoming.

I proudly serve as the CEO & Founder of ROGERS CORP.HOLDINGS, a company dedicated to building sustainable enterprises and empowering emerging entrepreneurs through strategic leadership and innovation. Alongside that, I am also the Co-Founder of CRE ENTERPRISE, a growing brand focused on creativity, resourcefulness, and excellence across multiple business sectors.

As a Businessman, I thrive on creating opportunities, developing partnerships, and building systems that add value to people and organizations. I believe business is not just about profit — it’s about problem-solving, innovation, and leaving a lasting legacy.

As a Forex Trader, I have cultivated strong analytical skills, patience, and risk management discipline. Trading has taught me resilience, focus, and the power of strategic decision-making under pressure.

In my role as a Politician, I am passionate about youth empowerment, social development, and transparent leadership. I strongly believe that young people hold the key to Africa’s transformation, and I aim to contribute to that change through advocacy, education, and community development.

As a Football Coach, I find joy in teamwork, mentorship, and building confidence in young athletes. Sports have always been a powerful tool for leadership and discipline, and I apply those same principles to every area of my life.

As a Writer, I use words to inspire, educate, and challenge perspectives. I write about business, technology, personal growth, and leadership — sharing insights drawn from my journey as a young entrepreneur and leader in progress.

💼 My Core Beliefs:
