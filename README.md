Hi, My name is Rogers Ugem Rogers, a 19-year-old Computer Science student at the University of Port Harcourt (UniPort). I’m passionate about innovation, leadership, and creating impact across multiple industries.

I proudly wear many hats — I’m a Businessman, a Forex Trader, a Politician, a Football Coach, and a Writer. I currently serve as the CEO & Founder of ROGERS CORP.HOLDINGS and Co-Founder of CRE ENTERPRISE.

My journey is driven by purpose, discipline, and a desire to bridge technology, business, and leadership to inspire the next generation. I believe in growth through learning, service through leadership, and impact through consistency.

When I’m not building companies or trading markets, you’ll probably find me writing, mentoring young people, or strategizing new ideas that empower communities.
